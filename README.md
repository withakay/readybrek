# readybrek - an example redis client library in c#

Readybrek impliments RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol) and communicates with a redis-server via a System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient instance.


rbcli is a command line redis client, in a similar vein to redis-cli, that makes use of Readybrek.Client to communicate with a redis-server.


This project is a toy, it is not intended for produciton use!
